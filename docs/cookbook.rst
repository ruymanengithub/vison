.. _cookbook:

This cook-book is an adaptation of a guide used during the actual calibration campaign. As such, it contains mentions to specific machines in MSSL, which are not really important to the workings of the code, but we have decided to leave the document as close to the original as possible, for it illustrate how the code was used in practice.
