Now that everything is set up, general workflow is to:

In the main repo:

* edit and commit code as usual
* document stuff in README.rst, commit it as usual
* document stuff that will be in the documentation, but not on the main page, 
   in other .rst files in the docs directory.
* change to docs dir and run make html to generate the html docs in your docs repo. 
  This should not make any changes to the main repo, so you dont have to commit 
  again if you are making a PDF manual, make that too with make latexpdf. Depending 
  on where you are putting the PDF manual, you will have to commit and push the new 
  version as well.
* git push
* change to the docs repo

Next, in the docs repo:

* change to the docs repo (make sure you are in the html dir)
* check to make sure you are on the gh-pages branch
* git commit -a -m "rebuilt docs"
* git push origin gh-pages
