Installing `conda` Environment and Dependencies
-----------------------------------------------

We recommend installing the code through a `conda` environment, with a specific list
of packages, so you can be sure you have all the needed dependencies.

First, if you don't have `conda` already installed in your system already, 
follow the instructions in this `link <https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html>`_.


Installing conda and creating `vison` environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have succesfully installed conda, we will create an environment that will
allow you to install the pipeline and meet all its dependencies.
